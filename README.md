# Pandas-Challenge

## PyCitySchools

### Description  

Using the provided CSV data files for school and students within a district, the assignment required analysis to be conducted through Pandas DataFrames.  

This analysis was broken down into sections. Within each section specific tasks needed to be completed on a merged DataFrame from the supplied Data. These sections were/contained:  

### District Summary  

Provide a high level overview of key metrics for the District:  

 - Total number of unique schools  
 - Total students  
 - Total budget   
 - Average math score   
 - Average reading score    
 - % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)   
 - % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)   
 - % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

### School Summary  

Provide a summary of key metrics by school:

 - School name    
 - School type   
 - Total students   
 - Total school budget   
 - Per student budget   
 - Average math score   
 - Average reading score   
 - % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)   
 - % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)   
 - % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)  

### Highest-Performing Schools  

Provide a list of the top 5 performing schools by the "% Overall Passing" metric   

### Lowest-Performing Schools

Provide a list of the bottom 5 performing schools by the "% Overall Passing" metric

### Math Scores by Grade  

Provide the average math score for each grade at each school

### Reading Scores by Grade   

Provide the average math score for each grade at each school

### Scores by School Spending   

Place the schools into categories (bins) based on their per student spending budget, and then provide a summary per School Spending Bins on:

 - Average math score   
 - Average reading score  
 - % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)   
 - % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)   
 - % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

### Scores by School Size   

Place the schools into categories (bins) based on their student count, and then provide a summary per School Student Count Bins on:

 - Average math score   
 - Average reading score  
 - % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)   
 - % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)   
 - % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

### Scores by School Type   

Place the schools into their school type categories, and then provide a summary per School Type on:

 - Average math score   
 - Average reading score  
 - % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)   
 - % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)    
 - % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)   

### Analysis  

Lastly provide an analysis report containing two key trends that can be obtained from the data. This can be found at the top of the "PyCitySchool.ipynb" file.
